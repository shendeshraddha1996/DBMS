Q1. Create a table called Cityorders. This will contain the same onum, amt and snum
    fields as the Orders table, and the same cnum and city fields as the Customers
    table, so that each customerâ€™s order will be entered into this table along with his
    or her city. Onum will be the primary key of Cityorders. All of the fields in
    Cityorders will be constrained to match the Customers and Orders tables. Assume
    the parent keys in these tables already have the proper constraints.

mysql> CREATE TABLE cityorders
    -> SELECT onum,amt,snum,cnum,city
    -> FROM orders_1
    -> NATURAL JOIN customers;
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.13 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 1

mysql> alter TABLE cityorders add constraint Onum_fk foreign key (Onum) references orders_1(Onum);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.21 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> desc cityorders;
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| onum  | int         | NO   | MUL | NULL    |       |
| amt   | float(7,2)  | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| snum  | int         | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| cnum  | int         | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| city  | varchar(10) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |

Q2. Redefine the Orders table as follows:- add a new column called prev, which will
    identify, for each order, the onum of the previous order for that current customer.
    Implement this with a foreign key referring to the Orders table itself. The foreign 0
    key should refer as well to the cnum of the customer, providing a definite 
    enforced link between the current order and the one referenced.

mysql> CREATE TABLE orders_3
    -> (
    -> Onum int(4) primary key,
    -> Amt float(7,2),
    -> Odate DATE,
    -> Cnum int(4),
    -> Snum int(4),
    -> prev int(4),
    -> foreign key(prev) references orders_3(Onum)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 5 warnings (0.11 sec)

mysql> desc orders_3;
+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type       | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Onum  | int        | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| Amt   | float(7,2) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| Odate | date       | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| Cnum  | int        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| Snum  | int        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| prev  | int        | YES  | MUL | NULL    |       |
