Q1. Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all
    customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High  
    Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.

mysql> SELECT cname,
    -> city,
    -> 'HIGH RATING' RATING
    -> FROM customers
    -> WHERE rating>=200
    -> UNION
    -> SELECT cname,
    -> city,
    -> 'LOW RATING' RATING
    -> FROM customers
    -> WHERE rating < 200;

mysql> select Cname , City , (case when rating >= 200 then 'High Rating' else 'Low rating'end )
      as rating from customers
    -> union
    -> select Cname , City , (case when rating < 200 then 'Low Rating' else 'High rating' end ) 


Q2. Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and
    each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical
    order.

mysql> select salespeople.Snum , Sname , Cname
    -> from salespeople , customers
    -> where salespeople.Snum = Customers.Snum
    -> and Customers.Snum in (Select Snum from customers
    -> GROUP BY Snum HAVING count(Snum) > 1)
    -> Order by Sname;

Q3. Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in
    San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the
    onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries
    but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.
    (Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is
    besides the point.)

mysql> select Snum from salespeople where city = 'San Jose'
    -> union
    -> select distinct Snum from orders
    -> where Snum in (Select snum from orders
    -> where Odate = '1990-10-03');
